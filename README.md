# C# CALORIES CALCULATOR & FITNESS ADVICE SOFTWARE
## Highschool Final Year Project

* The C# project includes a calories calculator, which takes in account the physical state of a person and calculates the daily calorie intake required for the ideal weight.
* Patientâ€™s data are stored in an XML file updated upon user input.
* Provides an UI with a short guide in fitness and nutrition.
* The work was done in pairs and in an organised manner by assigning our tasks through negotiation.
* The software is developed in Microsoft Visual Studio, and all the biometrics are calculated using medical established formulas, but the blended ideas emerging from the team made the final product possible.
